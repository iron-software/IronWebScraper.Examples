IronWebScraper offers a robust platform engineered to harvest data and resources from websites through the utilization of C# programming.

1. Add IronWebScraper to your project by installing it from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronWebScraper/).
2. Derive a new class from `WebScraper`.
3. Implement an `Init` method that leverages the `Request` method to target and process at least one URL.
4. Construct a `Parse` method for handling the requests, where you can also issue additional `Request` calls for more pages. To manipulate HTML elements, use `response.Css` which employs jQuery-like CSS selectors.
5. In your application, initiate an instance of the web scraper class you've created and execute the `Start();` method.
6. Explore our [C# webscraping tutorials](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/webscraper/tutorials/webscraping-in-c-sharp/) to gain deeper insights into developing sophisticated web crawlers using IronWebScraper.
