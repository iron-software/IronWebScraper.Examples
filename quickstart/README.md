# Web Scraping in C&#35;

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/docs/docs/>***


## Introduction to IronWebScraper

IronWebScraper is a sophisticated class library tailored for C# on the .NET framework, enabling developers to conveniently scrape and extract content from websites. This tool is exceptional for converting websites or intranets into structured databases or JSON formats, and is also adept at mass downloading documents from the web.

Iron Web Scraper offers functionality comparable to Python's Scrapy library, but with the added benefit of C#’s debugging capabilities, which allow developers to trace and debug the scraping process step-by-step.

## Getting Started with Installation

Begin by installing Iron Web Scraper either via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronWebScraper/) or by [directly downloading the DLL](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/webscraper/packages/IronWebScraper.zip) from the IronSoftware website.

You’ll find all necessary classes under the `IronWebScraper` namespace.

```shell
PM > Install-Package IronWebScraper
```

## Common Applications

### Converting Websites into Databases

IronWebScraper facilitates the reverse engineering of websites into organized databases, proving invaluable during transitions from old websites and intranets to modern C# applications.

### Website Content Migration

Effortlessly migrate full or partial website content using IronWebScraper. This method is often more efficient than traditional SQL migrations by simplifying data extraction visible on web pages, bypassing the need for intricate SQL data structures or queries.

### Enhancing Search Indexes

Utilize Iron Web Scraper to feed and refine the search indexes of your corporate websites or intranets by comprehensively reading and accurately extracting structured data.

IronWebScraper is perfectly suited for indexing, allowing solutions like IronSearch to integrate and leverage scraped data to enhance enterprise search capabilities.

## Implementing Iron WebScraper

To get accustomed to Iron Web Scraper, examining practical examples is advisable. Here’s a simple example that demonstrates how to scrape blog titles:

```csharp
using IronWebScraper;

namespace WebScrapingProject
{
    class MainClass
    {
        public static void Main(string [] args)
        {
            var scraper = new BlogScraper();
            scraper.Start();
        }
    }

    class BlogScraper : WebScraper
    {
        public override void Init()
        {
            this.LoggingLevel = WebScraper.LogLevel.All;
            this.Request("https://ironpdf.com/blog/", Parse);
        }

        public override void Parse(Response response)
        {
            foreach (var title_link in response.Css("h2.entry-title a"))
            {
                string title = title_link.TextContentClean;
                Scrape(new ScrapedData() { { "Title", title } });
            }

            if (response.CssExists("div.prev-post > a [href]"))
            {
                string nextPageLink = response.Css("div.prev-post > a [href]")[0].Attributes["href"];
                this.Request(nextPageLink, Parse);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example establishes a class for scraping a blog inside a namespace, where specific settings and the initial web request are set up in the `Init()` method. As the scraper runs, the `Parse()` method utilizes CSS selectors to extract data and schedules further pages to crawl if available.
