# Web Scraping with C&num;

***Based on <https://ironsoftware.com/docs/docs/>***


## Introduction to IronWebScraper

IronWebScraper is a C# class library and framework designed for the .NET environment that enables developers to programmatically navigate and extract content from websites. This tool is particularly effective for analyzing the structure of websites or intranets and converting their content into databases or JSON formats. Additionally, it facilitates the task of downloading multiple documents from the web.

IronWebScraper is often likened to Python's Scrapy library, yet it brings the robust features of C#, like the ability to debug and step through the code during the web scraping execution.

## Setting Up

To begin using IronWebScraper, you need to install it either via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronWebScraper/) or by [downloading the DLL](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/webscraper/packages/IronWebScraper.zip) directly from the official site.

All necessary classes can be located under the `IronWebScraper` namespace.

```shell
PM > Install-Package IronWebScraper
```

## Core Applications

### Converting Websites to Databases

IronWebScraper comes equipped with functionalities that assist you in transforming existing websites into structured databases. This conversion is particularly useful for incorporating content from older websites and intranets into new C# applications.

### Website Migration Efficiencies

Easily pull data from entire or partial websites using C#, which streamlines the migration or update processes of websites and intranets. This method allows for a simpler flat data interpretation seen on each webpage, eliminating the need for understanding old SQL data schemas or formulating complex SQL queries.

### Enhancing Search Indexes

Utilize IronWebScraper to retrieve structured data from your websites or intranets. Scrape every page to accurately furnish a search engine that can optimize internal navigation and retrievals.

IronWebScraper serves as the ideal foundation for populating search indexes. A search system like IronSearch can harness the structured content funneled by IronWebScraper to establish an advanced enterprise search network.

## Implementing IronWebScraper

For practical application, it's beneficial to review coding examples. Here's a simple illustration where we create a program to scrape blog titles from a website.

```csharp
using IronWebScraper;

namespace WebScrapingProject
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string [] args)
        {
            var blogScraper = new BlogScraper();
            blogScraper.Start();
        }
    }

    class BlogScraper : WebScraper
    {
        public override void Init()
        {
            this.LoggingLevel = WebScraper.LogLevel.All;
            this.Request("https://ironpdf.com/blog/", ParseTitles);
        }

        public override void ParseTitles(Response response)
        {
            foreach (var title in response.Css("h2.entry-title a"))
            {
                string titleText = title.TextContentClean;
                Scrape(new ScrapedData() { { "Title", titleText } });
            }

            if (response.CssExists("div.prev-post > a [href]"))
            {
                var nextPageLink = response.Css("div.prev-post > a [href]")[0].Attributes["href"];
                this.Request(nextPageLink, ParseTitles);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To tailor a scraper to a specific site, you'll extend the `WebScraper` class and add essential methods such as `Init`, to set initial configurations and launch the first scrape. Use `Parse` methods to handle page data extraction, selecting with CSS-like queries.
